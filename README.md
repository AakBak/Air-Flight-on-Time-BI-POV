## Introduction
This repository contains a detailed analysis of airline on-time data for the years 1991 and 2001, along with a Streamlit web application that provides insights and visualizations derived from the analysis. The primary goal of this project is to offer actionable insights for the aviation industry, aiding decision-making, strategic planning, and operational optimization for improved on-time performance and passenger satisfaction.

## Analysis Overview
The analysis encompasses various aspects of the airline on-time datasets, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models (Decision Trees and XGBoost). The comparison between 1991 and 2001 datasets highlights key characteristics influencing flight punctuality. The predictive and prescriptive analytics provide accurate delay predictions and actionable insights for minimizing flight delays.

## Web Application
To interact with the analysis results and visualizations, a Streamlit web application has been created. You can access the app [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AakBak/BI-Flights-1991-2001){:target="_blank"}. The app allows users to explore the trends, features, and insights derived from the analysis in a user-friendly manner.

## How to Run the Web Application Locally
To run the web application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
4. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL.

## Ethical Considerations
The project also addresses ethical considerations related to data collection and the integration of advanced technologies at airports. The README encourages users to be mindful of privacy, fairness, transparency, and legal compliance when utilizing similar data in their projects.

## Conclusion
The README file concludes by emphasizing the pivotal role of transparency, fairness, and traveler privacy in navigating the intersection of technological advancements and ethical considerations. It encourages a commitment to upholding ethical standards for fostering trust and advancing the aviation industry's efficiency and reliability.

Feel free to explore the analysis and insights through the web application and refer to the detailed report for a comprehensive understanding of the project. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
