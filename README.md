## Introduction
This repository contains a detailed analysis of airline on-time data for the years 1991 and 2001, along with a Streamlit web application that provides insights and visualizations derived from the analysis. The primary goal of this project is to offer actionable insights for the aviation industry, aiding decision-making, strategic planning, and operational optimization for improved on-time performance and passenger satisfaction.

## Analysis Overview
The analysis encompasses various aspects of the airline on-time datasets, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models (Decision Trees and XGBoost). The comparison between 1991 and 2001 datasets highlights key characteristics influencing flight punctuality. The predictive and prescriptive analytics provide accurate delay predictions and actionable insights for minimizing flight delays.

## Web Application
To interact with the analysis results and visualizations, a Streamlit web application has been created. You can access the app [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AakBak/BI-Flights-1991-2001){:target="_blank"}. The app allows users to explore the trends, features, and insights derived from the analysis in a user-friendly manner.

## How to Run the Web Application Locally
To run the web application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
