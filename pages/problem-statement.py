## Problem Statement
st.header("üîç Problem Statement:")

st.markdown("""
The airline industry constantly strives to enhance on-time performance, considering it a critical factor in customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. In the context of the provided data sets for the years 1991 and 2001, there is a need to analyze and compare the characteristics of flights that were on time in these two distinct periods. Additionally, the introduction of a comprehensive data collection system at a larger airport raises ethical concerns, particularly in the context of privacy, as outlined by Solove (2006).
""")

## Specific Objectives
st.header("üéØ Specific Objectives:")

st.markdown("""
1. **Comparison of On-Time Performance (1991 vs. 2001):**
   - Identify key factors characterizing flights that were on time in 1991 and 2001.
   - Analyze trends and patterns in on-time performance across the two years.
   - Assess any notable changes or similarities between the two time periods.

2. **Additional Analytics Question:**
   - Pose and answer a relevant analytics question, either predictive or prescriptive, to gain deeper insights into on-time performance.

3. **Ethical Considerations in Data Collection at Airports:**
   - Evaluate potential ethical dilemmas and problems that may arise from the planned data collection initiative at the larger airport.
   - Apply Solove's taxonomy of privacy to assess the implications of collecting data from travelers' smartphones, flight plans, passport control, security control, and their interactions with shops and restaurants.
   - Consider the ethical implications of implementing facial recognition systems in commercial spaces within the airport.

## Significance of the Study
st.header("üåê Significance of the Study:")

st.markdown("""
Understanding the characteristics of on-time flights in different years can provide valuable insights for airlines in optimizing their operations and improving punctuality. Additionally, the ethical evaluation of data collection practices is crucial to ensuring the protection of passengers' privacy rights and avoiding potential legal and reputational issues for the airport.

## Expected Outcomes
st.header("üìà Expected Outcomes:")

st.markdown("""
1. A comprehensive analysis of on-time performance characteristics in 1991 and 2001.
2. Insights from an additional analytics question, contributing to a better understanding of factors influencing on-time performance.
3. Identification of potential ethical dilemmas and privacy concerns associated with the proposed data collection initiatives at the larger airport.
""")

## Research Approach
st.header("üîç Research Approach:")

st.markdown("""
1. **Data Analysis:** Utilize statistical and exploratory data analysis techniques to compare on-time performance in 1991 and 2001.
2. **Analytics Modeling:** Employ predictive or prescriptive analytics techniques to answer the additional analytics question.
3. **Ethical Evaluation:** Apply Solove's taxonomy of privacy to systematically assess the ethical implications of the proposed data collection initiatives at the airport.
